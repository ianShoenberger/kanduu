- what about hamburger menu for each item?
    actions are: select for duuing, edit, delete, graph? move?
    metadata is: date last selected, number of child items?
- make some kind of css event once a user has cycled through all of the random possibilities
- maintain title and other element positioning/spacing when navigating from home to category screens
- have ability to select an item for duuing (arrow pointed to random element)
    once selected, show checkmark or some animation, then modal for 'keep' or 'remove' and with a 'dont ask again' checkbox
    log the time/date when selected

- graph for selected items
- set schedule or recurring tasks?
- don't transition list after closing the random wheel
- add radio buttons "category or item" in the add/edit modal
- make an opacity transition to the background colors on the random wheel when it's cycled through all options and at init
