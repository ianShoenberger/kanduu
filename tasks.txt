fix bug for choosing empty category
- what about hamburger menu for each item?
    actions are: select for duuing, edit, delete, graph?
    metadata is: date last selected, number of child items?
- make some kind of css event once a user has cycled through all of the random possibilities
- colors!!!
- maintain title and other element positioning/spacing when navigating from home to category screens
- have ability to select an item for duuing (arrow pointed to random element)
    once selected, show checkmark or some animation, then modal for 'keep' or 'remove' and with a 'dont ask again' checkbox
    log the time/date when selected

- graph for selected items
- set schedule or recurring tasks?

db schema:
{id: 1, name: 'movies', completed: false, items: [2, 5, 6, 7], parent: null}
